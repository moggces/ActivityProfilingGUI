# Tox21 Activity Profiler


This interactive application allows users to browse activity profiles from the Tox21 dataset.  The activities of chemicals (based on CASRN) are presented. The activities caused by known artifacts (e.g., cytotoxicity, quenching/autofluorescence) are flagged.

For a summary of data processing, see [this summary](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ptkna93n3nel8v/pipeline_summary.pdf?dl=0). The underlying data are available for browsing in a related application, the [Tox21 curve browser](/sandbox/tox21-curve-visualization/).

## Quick start

Paste the following data-table into the "CAS & Cluster" text-box.

<table class='table table-condensed table-striped'>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>CAS</th>
  <th>Cluster</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>83-79-4</td>
  <td>positive_zfish</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>80-05-7</td>
  <td>negative_zfish</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Note**: paste the data AND the header column

## Input details

### Required inputs

One of the two inputs below are required.

#### CAS & Cluster

A tab-delimited dataset (with header included). Two columns are allowed: chemicals and cluster. The clustercolumn is optional.

1. create one column (column name: CAS) or two columns of data (column names: CAS and Cluster) in Excel
  - CAS, chemical ID: one type is allowed, **CAS**
      - CAS: Chemical Abstracts Service registration ID, e.g., 83-79-4. Please put at least two CASRNs.
  - Cluster, chemical annotation: any annotation associated with the chemical that could be compared with the in vitro qHTS data
2. column names are case sensitive: **CAS** and **Cluster**
3. copy and paste to the text area

#### Data matrix

Alternatively, a data-matrix file can be uploaded.

1. the downloaded activity data can be modified and re-uploaded (e.g., add results from external assays)
2. the file names have to contain **nwauc.logit|npod|nac50**. So it will recognize the type of activity and use the respective coloring scheme.
2. other data matrix with **CAS** as ID and comparable activity information can be uploaded (However, currently data from non-Tox21 chemicals will be excluded).
3. **Cluster** information is optional.
4. **input_Chemical.Name** can be used to change the column names in the heatmap (optional).

**Notes:**
- _Activity filtering_ and _Enrichment Analysis_ function become invalid.
- _Assay filtering_ function is still functional.

### Additional inputs

* Profiling: Select from one of two profiling types:
  - signal: results observation, e.g., whether the compound causes increasing or decreasing signal
    + **signal type**: currently only wauc is available, suitable for compound grouping
  - activity: Results interpretation, e.g., whether the compound is active
    + An activity type can also be specified
    + **activity type**
      * wauc: overall effect of the chemical
      * pod: point-of-departure (depending on noise leve in the assay)
      * ac50: half-maximal effect concentration

<table class='table table-condensed table-striped'>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Value range</th>
  <th>Value description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>wauc</td>
  <td>0 ~ 1</td>
  <td>higher value -&gt; higher activity <br> 0 -&gt; inactive <br> 1E-4 -&gt; inconclusive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pod</td>
  <td>log10(M)*(-1)</td>
  <td>higher value -&gt; more potent <br> 1E-4 -&gt; inconclusive <br> 0 -&gt; inactive</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

ac50 type is same as pod type.

### Activity filtering
The default activity results are based on Curvep-wAUC pipeline (i.e. known artifacts are excluded). But the activities can be **further** filtered by following parameters.

* wAUC threshold: see above
* Emax threshold: half-maximal concentration (e.g., 30% relative to the positive control)
* POD threshold: (uM)
* AC50 threshold: (uM)
* log10(ratio of signal to cytotoxicity) (for inhibition-type assays): (e.g., 1 => 10 fold between signal and cytotoxicity).
* no cytotoxicity observed in tested concentration range (for nuclear receptor antagonism assays & aromatase inhibition assay): toggle ON to exclude any activity with cytotoxicity (information from the respective multiplexed assay) seen in the tested concentration range
* only curve class 1.1, 1.2, 2.1: toggle ON to include only activities from  two asymptote + strong/weak Emax + good fit or one asymptote + strong Emax + good fit in at least one run
* exclude high activity variation between sources: toggle OFF to include more potential activity. The included activities can still be recognized in the heatmap by the # sign
* exclude inconclusive label: ON makes all inconclusive (cytotoxic, artifacts, value = 1E-4) as inactives (value = 0)

### Compound sorting
The columns of the heatmap can be ordered in three methods:

1. structure similarity
    + Tanimoto coefficient based on Leadscope proprietary structural fingerprints
    + hierarchical clustering with average linkage
    + chemicals are grouped by cutoff 0.7
    + a new parameter is created, chemClust, where chemClust = 0, are the compounds that cannot form clusters or compounds without structures

2. activity similarity
    + Euclidean distance based on respective activities
    + hierarchical clustering with average linkage

3. toxicity score (only for __activity__)
    + sum of the activities (unbounded, dependent on # of assays used)
        + wauc: sum of wauc values
        + pod or ac50: sum of wauc-weighted pod or ac50 values (in data matrix input, sum of pod/ac50 values instead)

***

### Assay filtering

Please see the __Assays__ tab to get complete assay (common_name column) information

Simple regular expression rules:

1. how to get all specific assays
    + put _cytotoxicity_ in the text box plus toggle _ON_ invert your selection
2. how to get all antagonism or inhibition and specific assays
    + put antagonism\_|inhibition\_ in the text box plus toggle _OFF_ invert your selection (Note: _|_ means _OR_)
3. how to get all agonism and specific assays
    + put \\bagonism\_ in the text box plus toggle _OFF_ invert your selection

***


### Others

1. show the clustered dendrogram instead of the heatmap (toggle ON show compound similarity dendrogram)
2. limit the heatmap/potency plot in one page (toggle ON keep heatmap size one page)
3. adjust font size when downloading heatmap or online

  * Download Activities: if the data have not been released to PubChem, they will not be able to download
  * Save Plot (currently only for heatmap)

### Tabs

#### Input chemicals

If the input chemicals are not available, they will not have _GSID_.
Current information is based on EPA DSSTOX.

#### Profile

The heatmap will be displayed here.

##### Main map

* columns are compounds
* rows are assays
* cells are activities
* coloring scheme: please refer the color bar
* gray color: not tested. However if \"exclude inconclusive label\" ON, it could also mean _inconclusive_.

##### annotation map

* columns are compounds
* first row is toxScore (only available in __activity__)
* second row is userClust (__Cluster__)
* third row is chemCust

#### Potency plot

Only shown for pod or ac50 as activity.

#### Activity data

background data used for heatmap and potency plot

#### Enrichment analysis

* DAVID (more stringent) Fisher's exact test is applied
* n: number of compounds in a class; n\_p: number of actives in a class; N\_P: number of actives in the population;n: number of compounds in the population


#### Assays

assay information

### Troubleshooting

* DNA damage assays (activation\_DNA\_damage/dsb and activation\_DNA\_damage/srf) tend to have more false positives.
* Error: 'breaks' are not unique. It is possible that the input compounds are not active in any of the assays. Please add another compound (e.g. 80-05-7).
* The compound is missing on the heatmap. The compound may not be tested or none of its sources passes the chemical QC.


### Release notes
