## A R Shiny interface to explore activity profiling data
The pipeline identifies reproducible patterns in assays and interprets the results afterwards.

For a compound which is called as _active_ in in an assay. It could mean:

1. It may be an active relevant to pathways in human. 
2. It may be a cell-type specific active.
3. it may be an artifact not identified in current pipeline (e.g., frequent hitters in _Bla_ or _Luc_ technology)

### Requirement

* firefox or chrome browser with the link on NIEHS internal JOBS server [JOBS](http://jobs.niehs.nih.gov:3838/myapps/profiling2/) or Rstudio public Shiny server [shinyapps.io](https://hsiehjh.shinyapps.io/tox21actprofiler)

or

* download the shiny app from [ActivityProfilingGUI](https://github.com/moggces/ActivityProfilingGUI) and contact & contact [Jui-Hua Hsieh](mailto:juihua.hsieh@gmail.com) for background data


```{r eval=FALSE }
library(shiny)
runApp()
```

***

### Input
Two types of input are allowed: chemicals and data matrix

##### chemicals
1. creat two columns of data (i.e., chemical ID and its attribute) in excel
  + chemical ID: one type is allowed, **CAS**
      + CAS: Chemical Abstracts Service registration ID, e.g., 83-79-4
  + attribute: any class attribute associated with the chemical that could be compared with the in vitro data
2. create column names (case sensitive): **CAS** and **Cluster**
3. copy and paste to the text area

or **Cluster** columns can be omitted

###### Examples
CAS | Cluster
----| -------
83-79-4 | positive_zfish
80-05-7 | negative_zfish


##### data matrix (advanced function, instruction under construction):
1. the downloaded activitiy data data can be modified and re-uploaded.
2. the file names have to be **nwauc.logit|npod|nac50**. So it will recognize the coloring scheme.
2. other data matrix with **CAS** as ID and comparable activity information can be uploaded.
3. **Cluster** information is optional.
4. **input_Chemical.Name** information is optional (colnames of heat map will change).
bug: once add  **input_Chemical.Name**, Data and Potency boxplot tabs are not working.

###### Notes
* two forms of activity are allowed (see _activity type_), specified by the file name
    + nwauc.logit
    + npod or nac50
* _Activity filtering_ function becomes invalid 

***

### Profiling

##### signal
results observation, e.g., whether the compound causes increasing or decreasing signal

    * signal type
    currently only wauc is available, suitable for compound grouping
        
##### activity
results interpretation, e.g., whether the compound is active

    * activity type
        + wauc: overall effect of the chemical
        + pod: assay-dependent point-of-departure 
        + ac50: half-maximal effect concentration
    
###### activity type

type | value range | value description
-----|-------------| -----------------
wauc | 0 ~ 1 | higher value -> higher activity <br> 0 -> inactive <br> 1E-4 -> inconlusive
pod | log10(M)\*(-1) | higher value -> more potent <br> 1E-4 -> inconlusive <br> 0 -> inactive

ac50 type is same as pod type. 

***

### Activity filtering
The default activity results are based on pipeline. But the activities can be **further** filtered by following parameters. 

* wAUC threshold: see above
* Emax threshold: half-maximal concentration (e.g., 30% relative to the positive control)
* POD threshold: see above
* AC50 threshold: see above
* log10(ratio of signal to cytotoxicity) (for inhibition-type assays): (e.g., 1 => 10 fold between signal and cytotoxicity).
* not cytotoxic (for inhibition-type assays): toggle ON to exclude any activity interpreted under cytotoxicity condition
* only curve class 1.1, 1.2, 2.1: toggle ON to include only activities from  two asymptote + strong/weak Emax + good fit or one asymptote + strong Emax + good fit in at least one run
* exclude high activity variation between sources: toggle OFF to include more potential activity, however, these included activities can still be recognized in the heatmap by the # sign
* exclude inconclusive label: ON makes all inconclusives (cytotoxic, artifacts) as inactives 

***

### Compound sorting
The columns of the heatmap can be ordered in three methods:

1. structure similarity
    + Tanimoto cofficient based on Leadscope structural fingerprints
    + hierarchical clustering with average linkage
    + chemicals are grouped by cutoff 0.7
    + a new parameter is created, chemClust, where chemClust = 0, are the compounds that cannot form clusters or compounds without structures
    
2. activity similarity
    + Euclidean distance based on respective activities
    + hierarchical clustering with average linkage
    
3. toxicity score (only for __activity__)
    + sum of the activities (unbounded, dependent on # of assasy used)
        + wauc: sum of wauc values
        + pod or ac50: sum of wauc-weighted pod or ac50 values (not applicable for data matrix input)

***

### Assay filtering

Please see the __Assays__ tab to get complete assay (common_name column) information

Simple regular expression rules:

1. how to get all specific assays
    + put _cytotoxicity_ in the text box plus toggle _ON_ invert your selection
2. how to get all antagonism or inhibition and specific assays
    + put antagonism\_|inhibition\_ in the text box plus toggle _OFF_ invert your selection
3. how to get all agonism and specific assays
    + put \\bagonism\_ in the text box plus toggle _OFF_ invert your selection

***


### Others

1. show the clustered dendrogram instead of the heatmap (toggle ON show compound similarity dendrogram)
2. limit the heatmap/potency plot in one page (toggle ON keep heatmap size one page)
3. adjust font size when downloading heatmap or online

  * Download Activities: If the data haven\'t been released to PubChem, they won\'t be able to download
  * Save Plot

***

### Tabs

#### Input chemicals

If the input chemicals are not available, they will not have _GSID_. 
Current information is based on EPA DSSTOX. 

#### Profile

The heatmap will be displayed here. 

##### main map

* columns are compounds
* rows are assays
* cells are activities
* coloring scheme: please refer the color bar
* gray color: not tested. However if \"exclude inconclusive label\" ON, it could mean _inconclusive_.

##### annotation map

* columns are compounds
* first row is toxScore (only available in __activity__)
* second row is userClust (__Cluster__)
* third row is chemCust

#### Potency plot

Only for pod or ac50 as activity.

#### Data 

background data used for heatmap and potency plot

#### Assays

assay information
